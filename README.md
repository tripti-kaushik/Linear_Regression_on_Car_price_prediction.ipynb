This repository contains a Linear Regression model built to predict car prices based on various features such as mileage, engine size, horsepower, and other key attributes. The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between different factors affecting car prices and develop an accurate predictive model using machine learning techniques.

  1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
  
  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, correlations, and distributions of car prices.
  
  3.Model Training: Implementing Linear Regression using Python (sklearn).
  
  4.Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using RÂ² Score.
  
  5.Predictive Analysis: Making price predictions for new car listings.
